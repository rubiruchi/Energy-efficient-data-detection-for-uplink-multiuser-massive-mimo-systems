# Energy-efficient-data-detection-for-uplink-multiuser-massive-mimo-systems
The massive multiuser multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) system is widely used in wireless communications considering their reliability and data speed. In multiuser MIMO uplink communications, it is necessary to design linear schemes that can be able to suppress co-channel interferences (CCIs). The optimal and suboptimal data detection algorithms like linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE), coordinate descent method (CDM), etc., may not provide satisfactory bit error rate (BER) performance. Here, we analyze the maximum ratio combining (MRC) receiver for a very large scale multiuser MIMO system under a composite-fading environment. It is developed in the context of an MRC receiver to analyze the mean square error (MSE) parameter with respect to the total training power. Thus with the help of MRC combined with CDM technique, the proposed system results better MSE performance or BER performance.
